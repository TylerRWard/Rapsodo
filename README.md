# Welcome to My Project Repository ðŸ‘‹

This repository serves as a collection of various projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills and interests across multiple domains. As I continue learning and building, Iâ€™ll be adding new projects hereâ€”ranging from data analysis and machine learning to web development, system programming, and more!

## ðŸš€ Repository Overview

This repo is designed as a portfolio of my projects. Each project demonstrates specific techniques, languages, or tools I've explored, with descriptions, code, and any relevant documentation.

### Key Areas
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: Exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, data visualization, and more.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Applications using both frontend and backend technologies.
- **Systems Programming**: Low-level coding, algorithms, and efficient implementations.
- **Automation & Scripting**: Scripts and tools for automating tasks and data processing.
- **And More!**: As I continue adding, this repo will feature a diverse range of projects.

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

To explore individual projects:
1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Follow the specific `README.md` file in each folder for setup and usage instructions.

### Requirements
Most projects in this repository require:
- **Python 3.8+** for data science and scripting projects.
- **R** for data visualization apps.
- **C++** for systems programming.

To install required libraries for Python-based projects:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
