<h2>Description</h2>
This project was for my data science internship. We needed a way to automate retrieving the data from Rapsodos website to our own website we created. 

When running the rapsodo bot it automatically goes to the Lindenwood baseball rapsodo cloud database and downloads all of the data. 
It saves this data in a folder in the same directory called CSVOut.

The baseball bot takes about 50 seconds to run and grabs all pitches within the last month
The softball bot takes about 5 seconds and doesn't filter anything
